                <h3>Hello!</h3>

                <p>
                    I'm a student on a journey to becoming a full-stack web developer with a passion for turning big ideas into polished digital experiences. I’m diving deep into both front-end and back-end development because, hey, why choose between the two when you can have the best of both worlds?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that “Dream big, but build step by step” is more than just a motto—it’s a survival guide. Because let’s be honest: every great app starts with a bold vision... and then gets debugged into submission. My approach? Tackle the dream head-on, break it down into achievable goals, and maybe laugh a little at the chaos in between.

                <p>
                    When I’m not wrangling code or chasing down elusive bugs, I’m busy turning everyday challenges into creative projects. Whether it’s crafting clean code or designing user experiences that just work, I strive to blend functionality with a touch of elegance (and maybe a little flair for fun).

                    Thanks for stopping by my portfolio! This is where big ideas, constant learning, and a dash of humor come together.
                </p>
