                <h3>Hi there! 👋</h3>

                <p>I'm a web developer who believes that great design isn't just about making things look good—it's about making them feel right. Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect layouts or debugging that one stubborn line of code at 2 a.m., I’m all in.</p>
                <p>When I'm not busy coding, you'll find me designing creative solutions to everyday problems (like figuring out why my coffee keeps disappearing 🤔). My motto? "Good design is like good coffee: strong, simple, and keeps you going."</p>
                <p>I’ve spent the last few years perfecting my craft in web development and design, blending functionality with aesthetics. From minimalist portfolios to intricate e-commerce sites, I thrive on turning ideas into experiences that make people say, “Wow, this is exactly what I needed!”</p>
                <p>So, if you're here to explore, buckle up—my portfolio is where clean code meets cool design with just a dash of nerdy humor. And yes, every pixel is intentional. 😉</p>

                <p class="end">Let’s build something awesome together!</p>
