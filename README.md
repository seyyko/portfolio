Portfolio and Web Projects with Flask

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project contains my **portfolio** as well as other projects I've worked on during my studies and learning journey. It's a dynamic website built with **Flask**, a lightweight yet powerful Python framework.

About

This repository contains several sections:

- **Portfolio**: A showcase of my skills and professional achievements.
- **Web Projects**: Various projects I’ve built, including interactive web apps, APIs, and technical demos. Don’t worry, some of them might actually work.
- **Flask Website**: The site architecture is built with **Flask**, using features like Jinja templates, route management.

Features

- **Project Details**: Each project has its own dedicated page with detailed information and links to live demos or GitHub repositories. You’re welcome.

Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/seyyko/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   python3 -m venv venv

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - On Windows:
     - venv\Scripts\activate.bat (cmd)
     - venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 (powershell)
   - On macOS/Linux:
     source venv/bin/activate

4. **Install the dependencies**:

   The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. If it’s not, well, it’s probably your fault.

Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework.
- **Jinja2**: A template engine for rendering dynamic HTML. It’s like magic, but with code.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For structure, styling, and making sure the website doesn’t look like it was made in 1999.

Authors

- **Seyyko** – Lead developer (or "Flask wizard," depending on who you ask).
